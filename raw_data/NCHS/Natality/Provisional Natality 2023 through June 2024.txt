Caveats:
"1. Each birth record represents one liveborn infant."
"2. Data are provisional and subject to change."
"3. Births occurring through June 30, 2024 as of July 31, 2024."
"4. Caution should be used when interpreting the Average Age of Mother measure. All ages 12 years and less are coded to 12 years."
"All ages 50 years and over are coded to 50 years. The number of counts in those two age goups are small and should not have a"
"great effect on the average age. Consider doing queries with and without these two age groups and compare the effect on Average"
"Age of Mother measure."
"5. Please note that the Percent of Total presented here may not be consistent with percentages published by NCHS. NCHS excludes"
"births categorized as ""Unknown"", ""Not Stated"", and ""Not on Certificate"" from the denominator when calculating percentages."
