Caveats:
"1. Each birth record represents one liveborn infant."
"2. Birth rates are calculated as the number of births divided by total population in the given year(s). When the numerator is"
"sub-set by mother's race, location, or year of birth, then the same sub-set for age, race, location and year applies to the"
"denominator population."
"3. Fertility rates are calculated as the number of births divided by the number of females age 15 - 44 years old in the given"
"year(s). When the numerator is sub-set by mother's age, mother's race, location, or year of birth, then the same sub-set for"
"age, race, location and year applies to the denominator population. However, if you sub-set mother's age selecting some years"
"not in the 15 - 44 range, those years of mother's age ouside this range will not be included in the denominator population. If"
"you sub-set mother's age selecting only years outside the 15 - 44 range, the denominator population returned will be zero and"
"flagged ""Not Available""."
"4. Please note that the Percent of Total presented here may not be consistent with percentages published by NCHS. NCHS excludes"
"births categorized as ""Unknown"", ""Not Stated"", ""Not on Certificate"", ""Excluded"", and ""Not Reported"" from the"
"denominator when calculating percentages."
"5. Birth rates and fertility rates for years 2003-2006 are calculated using the revised intercensal bridged-race series of July"
"1st estimates of the resident population, released by NCHS on October 26, 2012. More information:"
